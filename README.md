| ✅                   | Basic GLFW window with color to confirm working and import of GLFW, openGL, and GLEW (completed during pre proposal research)                                                                                                                    | July 25          |
| ✅  | Use vertex and fragment shaders to display a shape to a window (completed during pre proposal research)                                                                                                                                          | July 25          |
| :white_large_square: | Abstract shaders and some related functionality into a class or set of functions for ease of use in the rest of the project.                                                                                                                     | July 26          |
| :white_large_square: | Implement agent class which handles position, velocity, and rotation of agent by following rules of the simulation. Utilize GLM library for vector data structure as well as matrix data structure if required.                                  | July 30          |
| :white_large_square: | Implement vertex and fragment shaders for rendering of agent to window                                                                                                                                                                           | August 2         |
| :white_large_square: | Create abstraction or helper functions for rendering of an entire group of agents to the window                                                                                                                                                  | August 5         |
| :white_large_square: | Add command line options to enable custom simulation parameters                                                                                                                                                                                  | August 5         |
| :white_large_square: | Attempt to improve runtime of each round of the program through spatial data structure such as a quadtree. This would allow for a greater amount of agents to be used in a single simulation. (Time permitting and not a promised functionality) | August 8         |
